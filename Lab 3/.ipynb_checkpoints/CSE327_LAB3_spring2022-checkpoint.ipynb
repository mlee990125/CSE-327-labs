    "## Problem 1: Tiny Image Representation + Nearest Neighbor Classifier\n",
    "{25 points} You will start by implementing the tiny image representation and the nearest neighbor classifier. They are easy to understand, easy to implement, and run very quickly for our experimental setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"tiny image\" feature is one of the simplest possible image representations. One simply resizes each image to a small, fixed resolution. You are required to **resize the image to 16x16**. It works slightly better if the tiny image is made to have zero mean and unit length (normalization). This is not a particularly good representation, because it discards all of the high frequency image content and is not especially invariant to spatial or brightness shifts. We are using tiny images simply as a baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nearest neighbor classifier is equally simple to understand. When tasked with classifying a test feature into a particular category, one simply finds the \"nearest\" training example (L2 distance is a sufficient metric) and assigns the label of that nearest training example to the test example. The nearest neighbor classifier has many desirable features — it requires no training, it can learn arbitrarily complex decision boundaries, and it trivially supports multiclass problems. It is quite vulnerable to training noise, though, which can be alleviated by voting based on the K nearest neighbors (but you are not required to do so). Nearest neighbor classifiers also suffer as the feature dimensionality increases, because the classifier has no mechanism to learn which dimensions are irrelevant for the decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Report your classification accuracy on the test sets and time consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints**:\n",
    "- Use [cv2.resize()](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/imgproc/doc/geometric_transformations.html#resize) to resize the images;\n",
